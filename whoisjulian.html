                <p> Hello my name is Julian. 
                    I'm 27 with such an obsession for music that it 
                    gets weird sometimes. I've been teaching myself how to play piano since the sixth grade and hopefully
                    I'll figure out how to force myself to learn guitar soon. I began music production my freshman year of college
                    and I fell in love with making music from my laptop.
                    Next year will mark ten years that I've been making music with a music daw. 
                    Coding reminds me of music production in some ways that makes
                    me feel a bit more confident when it comes to learning this craft. 
                    I could find so many ways to make music tie into the coding world but lets get to the good part. 
                    Other than Myspace I had no experience with coding until 
                    I decided to take this coding bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. However, 
                    I now find myself becoming more obsessed with mastering coding 
                    everyday. 
                </p>
